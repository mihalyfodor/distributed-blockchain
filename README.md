# Java implementation of a blockchain

The aim of this project is to implement a simple blockchain, to see how it works.
It is the continuation of my previous approach - https://github.com/mihalyfodor/blockchain-hello

The goal would be having two modules:

* Wallet - would be the "local" client, and should have several instances running
* Repository - would be the central point where clients can log in

A repository is considered to avoid direct peer2peer communication.

Status overview:

# Wallet
* Implementing basic chain - done
* Adding security (private/public keys) - todo
* Interacting with another wallet - todo
* UI with Angular - todo

# Repository
* Implementing basic logic - todo
* UI with Angular - todo
